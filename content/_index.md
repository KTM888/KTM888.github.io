I am a Cyber Practioner, currently studying in London, aspiring to work in the field of InfoSec. I enjoy messing around with hardware and software to find and exploit vulnerabilities ðŸ˜œ, and compete with others in CTF challenges. The writings samples in this portfolio will show my progresive lerning skills, creativity and problem-solving that I have developed over the years.
