      <description>Intro Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a CakePHP app for a client, your own personal CMS, or any other web based application. If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.
 First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;quot; attack.</description>

Planning the Project  It is important to plan out each project before you start beginning programming, this is because you will have a better understanding of how your program will look like and also you will manage your time wisely. To do this, you will have to make a description of your program like so;  In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen.</description>
